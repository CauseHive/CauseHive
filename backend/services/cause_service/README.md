## ‚öíÔ∏è Workflow

### Cause Creation Flow
1. Organizer creates a new cause via `POST /causes/create/`
2. System validates organizer ID against User Service
3. Cause is created with 'under_review' status
4. Cover image is uploaded and stored
5. Slug is automatically generated from cause name
6. Admin reviews and approves the cause

### Cause Lifecycle
1. **Under Review**: Cause is created and awaiting admin approval
2. **Upcoming**: Cause is approved and scheduled
3. **Ongoing**: Cause becomes active (based on start_date)
4. **Completed**: Cause finishes (based on end_date or target reached)
5. **Cancelled**: Cause is cancelled by organizer or admin

### Admin Approval Workflow
1. Admin receives notification of new pending cause
2. Admin reviews cause details and documentation
3. Admin approves or rejects the cause
4. Status is updated accordingly
5. Organizer is notified of the decision
