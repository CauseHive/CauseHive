## ÔøΩÔøΩ API Endpoints

### Cause Endpoints
- `GET /causes/list/` - List all causes
- `POST /causes/create/` - Create a new cause
- `GET /causes/details/<uuid:id>/` - Get specific cause details
- `DELETE /causes/delete/<uuid:id>/` - Delete a cause

### Category Endpoints
- Category management endpoints (CRUD operations)
- Category listing and filtering

## üìä Data Models

### Cause Model
```python
class Causes(models.Model):
    id = models.UUIDField(primary_key=True)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255, unique=True)
    category = models.ForeignKey('categories.Category')
    description = models.TextField()
    organizer_id = models.UUIDField()
    target_amount = models.DecimalField()
    current_amount = models.DecimalField(default=0.00)
    start_date = models.DateTimeField()
    end_date = models.DateTimeField()
    location = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    status = models.CharField(choices=STATUS_CHOICES)
    cover_image = models.ImageField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    slug = models.SlugField(unique=True)
```

**Status Options:**
- `upcoming` - Cause is scheduled but not yet started
- `ongoing` - Cause is currently active and accepting donations
- `completed` - Cause has finished successfully
- `cancelled` - Cause was cancelled

### Category Model
```python
class Category(models.Model):
    id = models.UUIDField(primary_key=True)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255, unique=True)
    description = models.TextField()
    slug = models.SlugField(unique=True)
```

## üîÑ Workflow

### Cause Creation Flow
1. Organizer creates a new cause via `POST /causes/create/`
2. System validates organizer ID against User Service
3. Cause is created with 'upcoming' status
4. Cover image is uploaded and stored
5. Slug is automatically generated from cause name

### Cause Lifecycle
1. **Upcoming**: Cause is created and scheduled
2. **Ongoing**: Cause becomes active (based on start_date)
3. **Completed**: Cause finishes (based on end_date or target reached)
4. **Cancelled**: Cause is cancelled by organizer

### Integration with Donation Service
- Cause IDs are referenced by the donation processing service
- Current amount is updated when donations are received
- Status may change based on fundraising progress

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### External Service Integration
The service integrates with external services for validation:
- **User Service**: Validates organizer IDs and user permissions

### Image Storage
- Cover images are stored in `causes_images/` directory
- Automatic file organization and naming
- Support for various image formats

## üîí Security

- All sensitive data stored in environment variables
- UUID-based primary keys for enhanced security
- Proper permission validation for cause management
- Input validation and sanitization
- Slug generation prevents URL manipulation

```

### Database Configuration
```env
DB_NAME=cause_service_prod
DB_USER=production_user
DB_PASSWORD=secure_password
DB_HOST=your-db-host
DB_PORT=5432
```
