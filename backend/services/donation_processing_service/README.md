4. System initiates payment via Paystack
5. On payment success, cart status is updated to 'completed'

### Payment Processing Flow
1. Payment is initiated via Paystack
2. User completes payment on Paystack
3. Paystack sends webhook to `/api/payments/webhook/`
4. System verifies payment and updates transaction status
5. Donation status is updated based on payment result

### Withdrawal Processing Flow
1. Cause organizer creates withdrawal request (`POST /api/withdrawals/`)
2. System validates user, cause, and withdrawal amount
3. System extracts payment details from user's profile
4. Paystack transfer is initiated with recipient creation/reuse
5. Transfer status is tracked and updated
6. Email notification sent on successful withdrawal
7. Admin can retry failed withdrawals
